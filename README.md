An Online Password Calculator is a versatile tool designed to evaluate the strength, complexity, and security of passwords. It helps users generate robust passwords that are resistant to common cyber threats, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and social engineering.
Key Features:

    Password Strength Assessment: Quickly analyzes the strength of a given password based on length, character variety, and entropy.
    Custom Password Generation: Creates secure passwords using user-defined parameters, such as character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) and length.
    Time-to-Crack Estimation: Estimates the time it would take for an attacker to crack the password using brute force methods.
    Real-Time Feedback: Provides recommendations for improving password strength, such as adding more characters or including diverse character types.
    User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for ease of use, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

Benefits:

    Enhances online security by promoting the use of strong passwords.
    Helps users understand vulnerabilities in weak passwords.
